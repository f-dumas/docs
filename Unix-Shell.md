# Bash / Shell

## How to execute scripts

First of all, you need to add the right to be executed on your machine:
```
chmod +x the-script.sh
```

You could want to create aliases in your `.bashrc` file:
```
alias="/the-path-to-the-repo/the-script.sh -with option"
```

Or add a symlink in your `bin` folder:

```
cd ~/bin
ln -s /the-path-to-the-repo/the-script.sh my-file.sh
chmod +x my-file.sh 
```

### Structure

Begin your file with
```
#!/bin/bash
```

Execute the file:
```
chmod +x my-script.sh
```

### Tips 

Get current directory :

```
dir="$1"
# No directory has been provided, use current
if [ -z "$dir" ]
then
    dir="`pwd`"
fi
```
